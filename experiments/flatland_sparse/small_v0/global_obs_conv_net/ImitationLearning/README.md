## Instructions to run

Global obs requirea a lot of memory to run. An experiment was run with the below config

```bash python trainImitate.py -f MARWIL.yaml --ray-object-store-memory 55000000000 --ray-memory 55000000000 --ray-redis-max-memory 55000000000 ```

Performance was poor with ~25-30% completion rate
