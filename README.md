# ðŸš‚ Flatland Baselines

This repository contains reinforcement learning baselines for the [NeurIPS 2020 Flatland Challenge](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/neurips-2020-flatland-challenge/) based on RLlib.

**Read the [baseline documentation](https://flatland.aicrowd.com/research/baselines.html) to see how to setup and use the baselines.**

Looking for something simpler? We also provide a DQN method implemented from scratch using PyTorch: https://gitlab.aicrowd.com/flatland/flatland-examples
